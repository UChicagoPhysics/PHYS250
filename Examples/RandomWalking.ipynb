    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to follow-up on the discussion in lecture with some actual computation regarding the random walking simulation. This is a simple version of a more general set of algorithms called a *Markov Chain Monte Carlo* or MCMC. These are extremely common in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and industry generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "You should learn a few things from this particular example, both technical and conceptual:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to build a randomized array, or field, of values using a loop\n",
    "1. Constructing a random path in two dimensions using those random steps\n",
    "1. Visualizing the path constructed\n",
    "1. Using built-in `numpy` library functions to build a randomize array of *steps*\n",
    "1. Understand a few more methods for array slicing and selection in `python`\n",
    "1. Using the cumulative summation function `cumsum` to turn the random steps into a randomized path\n",
    "1. Using the `%timeit` function to evaluate the time required to execute the two approaches"
